### Keep Updated

# Check for updates
gitforge version

# Re-run installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItzPhantomm/gitforge/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Secure Configuration
- Store tokens in environment variables, not config files
- Use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` env vars
- Enable GPG signing for commits
- Review plugin permissions before installing

### Plugin Security
- Only install plugins from trusted sources
- Review plugin permissions before installing
- Prefer official plugins (`gitforge/`)
- Check `gitforge plugin list` regularly

## Security Features
